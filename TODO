This does not describe the goals and visions but short term things that should
not be forgotten and are not done yet because I was lazy or did not decide
about the right way to do it yet.

- Declaring a variable, function, etc. twice is not detected in semantic phase
- having the same entry twice in a struct is not detected
- lexer does not produce multiple DEDENTS yet
- array access
- correct pointer arithmetic

Tasks suitable for contributors, because they don't affect the general design
or need only design decision in a very specific part of the compiler and/or
because they need no deep understanding of the design.

- Add option parsing to the compiler, pass options to backend as well
- Use more firm optimisations
- Create an eccp like wrapper script
- Add a sizeof operator
- Add an alloca operator
- forward source references to firm nodes
