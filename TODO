This does not describe the goals and visions but short term things that should
not be forgotten and are not done yet because I was lazy or did not decide
about the right way to do it yet.

- semantic should check that structs don't contain themselfes
- having the same entry twice in a struct is not detected
- correct pointer arithmetic
- A typeof operator (resulting in the type of the enclosed expression)
- change lexer to build a decision tree for the operators (so we can write
  <void*> again...)
- add possibility to specify default implementations for typeclass functions
- add static ifs that can examine const expressions and types at compiletime

Tasks suitable for contributors, because they don't affect the general design
or need only design decision in a very specific part of the compiler and/or
because they need no deep understanding of the design.

- Add parsing of floating point numbers in lexer
- Add option parsing to the compiler, pass options to backend as well
- Use more firm optimisations
- Create an eccp like wrapper script
- Add an alloca operator
- create a ++ and -- operator
- make lexer accept \r, \r\n and \n as newline
- make lexer unicode aware (so we can read different encodings and utf8)
