- Declaring a variable, function, etc. twice is not detected in semantic phase
- having the same entry twice in a struct is not detected
- lexer does not produce multiple DEDENTS yet

Smaller tasks:
- Add option parsing to the compiler, pass options to backend as well
- Start more firm optimisations
- Create an eccp like wrapper script
