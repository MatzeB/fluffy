 * 
 * We assume the start block of a procedure is executed once.  Based on this we
 * compute the execution freqency of all blocks.
 * 
 * The computation of the frequencies depends on the count of exception control
 * flow computed during the interval analysis.  The interval analysis again
 * depends on stuff computed here.
