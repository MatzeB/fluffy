/**
 * @file callgraph.h
 *
 * This file contains the representation of the callgraph.
 * The nodes of the call graph are ir_graphs.  The edges between 
 * the nodes are calling relations.  I.e., if method a calls method
 * b at some point, there is an edge between a and b.  
 *
 * Further this file contains an algorithm to construct the call
 * graph.  The construction of the callgraph uses the callee
 * information in Call nodes to determine which methods are called.
 *
 * Finally this file contains an algorithm that computes backedges
 * in the callgraph, i.e., the algorithm finds possibly recursive calls.
 * The algorithm computes an upper bound of all recursive calls.
