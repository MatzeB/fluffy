/** Computes type information for each node in all ir graphs.
 *
 * Computes type information for each node.  Stores the information in the
 * field defined in irtypeinfo.h. Sets typestate in irg to irg_typeinfo_consistent.
 *
 * Derives the information from nodes/patterns that give hints about the
 * type, as projecting an argument from the Start node.  Deletes all previous
 * type information.
 *
 * If a non-pointer type is specified for a pointer value (as the Alloc node does:
 * it contains the type allocated, but to type the result we need the type that
 * describes a pointer to the allocated type) searches for a corresponding pointer
 * type.  If several exist, uses one of them.  If none exists, uses unknown_type.
 *
 * Uses the link field of types.  Sets this field of each type to point to a
 * pointer type that points to the type (Got it? ;-)).

 *  Calls the same basic analyses routine for a node as simple_analyse_types,
 *  but returns unknown_type for Phi nodes.
 *  Each call is theoretically O(n).
 *
 *  Not yet implemented, but I guess we want this for iropt, to find the
 *  type for newly allocated constants.
