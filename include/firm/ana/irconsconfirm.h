 *
 * Confirm nodes carry confirmation information, such as
 * a relation between a value a and another value (or a constant)
 * b.
 *
 * These allows to do some range dependent optimizations for Cmp,
 * Abs, Min, Max nodes as well as bounds checking deletion.
 *
 * The heap analysis might profit also. On the other side, Confirm
 * nodes disturb local optimizations, because patterns are destroyed.
 *
 * It is possible to avoid this by skipping Confirm nodes, but this
 * is not implemented and is not cheap. The same happens with Casts
 * nodes too. The current solution is to remove Confirms at a later
 * pass.
