 * - variables from different segments never alias (R1)
 *   - a global variable and a local one never alias (R1 b)
 *   - a global variable and a TLS one never alias (R1 c)
 *   - a local variable and a TLS one never alias (R1 d)
 *   - a local variable and a parameter never alias (R1 e)
 * - two different variables never alias (R2)
 * - if one is a variable which address has never taken
 *   there is no alias (R3)
 * - if two memory addresses have the same base and there offsets
 *   do not describe overlapping regions there is no alias (R4)
 * - if opt_strong_typed is set and both addresses describe entities,
 *   different types never alias (R5)
 *
 * If none of these rules apply, the points-to framework must be
 * interrogated to detect the alias relation.
