/**

 *
 *  This is the Firm interface to debugging support.
 *
 *  @author Goetz Lindenmaier, Michael Beck
 *
 *  Firm requires a debugging module fulfilling this interface, else no
 *  debugging information is passed to the backend.
 *  The interface requires a datatype representing the debugging
 *  information.  Firm supports administrating a reference to the debug
 *  information in every Firm node.  Further Firm optimizations call
 *  routines to propagate debug information from old nodes to new nodes
 *  if the optimization replaces the old ones by the new ones.

 *
 *   - dbg_info_merge_pair() is called in the following situation:
 *     The optimization replaced the old node by the new one.  The new node
 *     might be a recent allocated node not containing any debug information,
 *     or just another node from somewhere in the graph with the same
 *     semantics.
 *   - dbg_info_merge_sets() is called in the following situation:
 *     The optimization replaced a subgraph by another subgraph.  There is no
 *     obviously mapping between single nodes in both subgraphs.  The optimization
 *     simply passes two lists to the debug module, one containing the nodes in
 *     the old subgraph, the other containing the nodes in the new subgraph.
 *     The same node can be in both lists.
 *
 *   Further both functions pass an enumeration indicating the action
 *   performed by the transformation, e.g. the kind of optimization performed.
 *
 * The third argument snprint_dbg is called to convert a debug info into a human readable string.
 * This string is the dumped in the dumper functions.
 *
 * Note that if NULL is passed for dbg_info_merge_pair or dbg_info_merge_sets, the default
 * implementations default_dbg_info_merge_pair() and default_dbg_info_merge_sets() are used.
 * NULL passed for snprint_dbg means no output.
