 * Entities represent all program known objects.

 * @author Martin Trapp, Christian Schaefer
 * @author Goetz Lindenmaier
 *
 * An entity is the representation of program known objects in Firm.
 * The primary concept of entities is to represent members of complex
 * types, i.e., fields and methods of classes.  As not all programming
 * language model all variables and methods as members of some class,
 * the concept of entities is extended to cover also local and global
 * variables, and arbitrary procedures.
 *
 * An entity always specifies the type of the object it represents and
 * the type of the object it is a part of, the owner of the entity.
 * Originally this is the type of the class of which the entity is a
 * member.
 * The owner of local variables is the procedure they are defined in.
 * The owner of global variables and procedures visible in the whole
 * program is a universally defined class type "GlobalType".  The owner
 * of procedures defined in the scope of an other procedure is the
 * enclosing procedure.

/**
 * @page ir_entity  Representation of an program entity.
 *
 * The type ir_entity is an abstract data type to represent program entities.
 * If contains the following attributes:
 *
 *   - owner:      A compound type this entity is a part of.
 *   - type:       The type of this entity.
 *   - name:       The string that represents this entity in the source program.
 *   - allocation: A flag saying whether the entity is dynamically or statically
 *                 allocated (values: dynamic_allocated,  static_allocated,
 *                 automatic_allocated).
 *   - visibility: A flag indicating the visibility of this entity (values: local,
 *                 external_visible,  external_allocated)
 *   - variability: A flag indicating the variability of this entity (values:
 *                  uninitialized, initialized, part_constant, constant)
 *   - volatility: @@@  
 *   - offset:     The offset of the entity within the compound object in bytes.  Only set
 *                 if the owner in the state "layout_fixed".
 *   - offset_bits_remainder:   The offset bit remainder of a bitfield entity (in a compound)
 *                 in bits.  Only set if the owner in the state "layout_fixed".
 *   - overwrites: A list of entities overwritten by this entity.  This list is only
 *                 existent if the owner of this entity is a class.  The members in
 *                 this list must be entities of super classes.
 *   - overwrittenby: A list of entities that overwrite this entity.  This list is only
 *                 existent if the owner of this entity is a class.  The members in
 *                 this list must be entities of sub classes.
 *   - link:       A void* to associate some additional information with the entity.
 *   - irg:        If the entity is a method this is the ir graph that represents the
 *                 code of the method.
 *   - peculiarity: The peculiarity of the entity.  If the entity is a method this
 *                 indicates whether the entity represents
 *                 a real method or whether it only exists to describe an interface.
 *                 In that case there nowhere exists code for this entity and this entity
 *                 is never dynamically used in the code.
 *                 Values: description, existent.  Default: existent.
 *   - visited:    visited flag.  Master flag is type_visited.
 *
 * These fields can only be accessed via access functions.
