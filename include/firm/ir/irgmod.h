 * new_block.  Moves all Projs that depend on moved nodes and are in old_block
 * to new_block. Moves all Phi nodes from old_block to new_block.  To achieve
 * this the routine assumes that all Phi nodes are in a list (using the link
 * field) in the link field of old_block.  Further it assumes that all Proj nodes
 * are accessible by the link field of the nodes producing the Tuple. This
 * can be established by collect_phiprojs().  part_block conserves this property.
 * Adds a Jmp node to new_block that jumps to old_block.
 * Assumes that node is contained in current_ir_graph.  Sets current_block in
 * this ir_graph to new_block.

 * @param node   The node were to break the block
