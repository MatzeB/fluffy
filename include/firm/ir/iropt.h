 * The Floating point model.

 * Several basic properties are defined:
 * - fp_explicit_rounding
 * - fp_strict_algebraic
 * - fp_contradictions
 * - fp_strict_eval_order
 * - fp_exceptions
 * - fp_environment_access
 *
 * From those basic properties three general models are defined,
 * compatible to the VC8 compiler:
 * - fp_model_precise:
 *     Default mode. Associative and distributive law forbidden unless a transformation
 *     is guaranteed to produce the same result.
 *     No FPU environment access. No FP exception semantics.
 * - fp_model_strict:
 *     Slowest mode. Additionally to fp_model_precise allows correct handling of
 *     FP exceptions and FPU environment access.
 * - fp_model_fast: 
 *     Fastest mode. Associative and distributive law allowed at the expense
 *     of floating point accuracy and correctness. Explicit rounding is disabled.
