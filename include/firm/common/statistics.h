 *  This file defines a set ouf routines to output statistics
 *  about the firm library.  These statistics include
 *   - number of datastructures allocated, as entities, types, nodes...
 *   - memory consumption of data structures
 *   - effectiveness of optimizations
 *   - ... more to come. 
 *
 *  This file is thought for compiler optimization, not to run it in a 
 *  production compiler. I.e., the routines may be inefficient.
