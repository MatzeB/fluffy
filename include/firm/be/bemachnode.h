/*
 * Machine nodes can have machine operands as inputs.
 * Machine operands are trees of other machine operands.
 * The leafs of machine operands are normal Firm nodes
 * or a machine operand with arity 0.
 *
 * The arity of a machine node is the number of leafs
 * that are NOT machine operands.
 *
 * For instance Add(x, Const) have the arity 1 if Const is a
 * machine operand, Add(x, ADR(b, i)) have arity 3.
 *
 * We simulate the the normal concept of get_irn_n/set_irn_n.
 * Instead of the node machine handle are used which are just
 * caches for the leaf positions of a machine node.
 * This means, it is only possible to manipulate the leafs!
 * Do not mix _mirn_ and _irn_ calls or terrible things can happen :-)
 *
 * Note further that currently the number of ins for a machine
 * instruction is limited to 8 + arity of Firm node which means
 * up to 8 registers can be added due to machine operands.
 *
 * Moreover machine handles must be destroyed yet...
 *
 * The convenience functions create the handle and drop it at the end.
 * as operands are seldom, they have a complexity of O(#predecessors)
 * which is near to O(1) for most node but use them seldom ...
