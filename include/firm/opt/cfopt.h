/** Control flow optimization.
 *
 * Removes empty blocks doing if simplifications and loop simplifications.
 * A block is empty if it contains only a Jmp node and Phi nodes.
 * Merges single entry single exit blocks with their predecessor 
 * and propagates dead control flow by calling equivalent_node().
 * Independent of compiler flag it removes Tuples from cf edges,
 * Bad predecessors from Blocks and Phis, and unnecessary predecessors of End.
 *
 * @bug So far destroys backedge information.
 * @bug Chokes on Id nodes if called in a certain order with other 
 *      optimizations.  Call local_optimize_graph() before to remove
 *      Ids.
