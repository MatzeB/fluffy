 *    class C extends B {}
 *  we transforms a cast

 *  The algorithm works for Casts with class types, but also for Casts
 *  with all pointer types that point (over several indirections,
 *  i.e. ***A) to a class type.  Normalizes all graphs.  Computes type
 *  information (@see irtypeinfo.h) if not available.
 *  Invalidates trout information as new casts are generated.

 *    search to find an existing pointer type.  If it can not find a type, 
 *    generates a pointer type with mode_P_mach and suffix "cc_ptr_tp".
