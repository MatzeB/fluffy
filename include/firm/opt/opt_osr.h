 * Do the Operator Scalar Replacement optimization and linear
 * function test replacement for loop control.
 * Can be switched off using the set_opt_strength_red() flag.
 * In that case, only remove_phi_cycles() is executed.
 *
 * @param irg    the graph which should be optimized
 * @param flags  set of osr_flags
 *
 * The linear function replacement test is controlled by the flags.
 * If the osr_flag_lftr_with_ov_check is set, the replacement is only
 * done if do overflow can occur.
 * Otherwise it is ALWAYS done which might be insecure.
 *
 * For instance:
 *
 * for (i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
 *
 * might be replaced by
 *
 * for (i = 0; i < 400; i += 4)
 *
 * But
 *
 * for (i = 0; i < 0x7FFFFFFF; ++i)
 *
 * will not be replaced by
 *
 * for (i = 0; i < 0xFFFFFFFC; i += 4)
 *
 * because of overflow.
 *
 * More bad cases:
 *
 * for (i = 0; i <= 0xF; ++i)
 *
 * will NOT be transformed into
 *
 * for (i = 0xFFFFFFF0; i <= 0xFFFFFFFF; ++i)
 *
 * although here is no direct overflow. The OV occurs when the ++i
 * is executed (and would created an endless loop here!).
 *
 * For the same reason, a loop
 *
 * for (i = 0; i <= 9; i += x)
 *
 * will NOT be transformed because we cannot estimate whether an overflow
 * might happen adding x.
 *
 * Note that i < a + 400 is also not possible with the current implementation
 * although this might be allowed by other compilers...
 *
 * Note further that tests for equality can be handled some simpler (but are not
 * implemented yet).
 *
 * This algorithm destroys the link field of nodes.
