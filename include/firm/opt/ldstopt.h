/** Load/Store optimization.
 *
 * Removes redundant non-volatile Loads and Stores.
 * May introduce Bad nodes if exceptional control flow
 * is removed. The following cases are optimized:
 *
 * Load without result: A Load which has only a memory use
 *   is removed.
 *
 * Load after Store: A Load after a Store is removed, if
 *   the Load doesn't have an exception handler OR is in
 *   the same block as the Store.
 *
 * Load after Load: A Load after a Load is removed, if the
 *   Load doesn't have an exception handler OR is in the
 *   same block as the previous Load.
 *
 * Store before Store: A Store immediately before another
 *   Store in the same block is removed, if the Store doesn't
 *   have an exception handler.
 *
 * Store after Load: A Store after a Load is removed, if the
 *   Store doesn't have an exception handler.
