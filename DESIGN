- Input: utf-8
- python like indentation to form blocks, but force user to either use spaces or tabs to indent

- Only 1 hierarchic namespace (so 1 name specifies alway the same thing,
  independent of the context; Different things might be defined in the
  hierarchy)


To-Design:

Namespacing:
	- How to handle modules, imports, exports, libraries?
	- Should we have file-local things?
	== Modules ==
	Each file belongs to exactly 1 module. If there's no module specified then
	stuff will go to the anonymous "main" module.

	Modules are specified by the module command.
	Modulenames are a URL without the protocol part or optionally protocol
	"fluffymodule://"

	All files of a module have to be compiled together.

	A recommendataion for naming is using internet urls:
	module fluffy.org/stdlib

	(Practical question 1: should we allow all possible strings? Or just
	 stuff which is allowed in filenames?)

	- Think about a 2nd model where all files in a directory form a module
	with a separate module description file in the directory...
